2015-Vision
===========

This is FRC team 4529's vision system.
It is programmed in C++, and is made to run both on the driver station, as well as the RoboRIO itself!

See http://frc4529.github.io/2015-Vision for docs on setting up and using the library.

#### WARNING
This is still incomplete. It is untested running natively on the RoboRIO.
Documentation and API may change, and this will not currently compile to a usable library without modifications!

**BUT!**

The API may not be finalized, and nor may be the code, but it is very close to it.
Only minor things can/should change, such as calling conventions and method/class/struct names, as well as enum values.

The core code should not change, but it is not 100% cemented down. The core ideas/functionality/usability will not change in any major way.
